## Terminology

**WiFi**

**Wi-Fi** or **WiFi** is a technology that allows electronic devices to connect to a wireless LAN (WLAN) network, mainly using the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands. A WLAN is usually password protected, but may be open, which allows any device within its range to access the resources of the WLAN network.

The Wi-Fi Alliance defines Wi-Fi as any "wireless local area network" (WLAN) product based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) 802.11 standards. However, the term "Wi-Fi" is used in general English as a synonym for "WLAN" since most modern WLANs are based on these standards. "Wi-Fi" is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance. The "Wi-Fi Certified" trademark can only be used by Wi-Fi products that successfully complete Wi-Fi Alliance interoperability certification testing.

**Station**

In IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) terminology, a **station (STA)** is a device that has the capability to use the 802.11 protocol.
For example, a station may be a laptop, a desktop PC, PDA, access point or Wi-Fi phone. An STA may be fixed, mobile or
portable. Generally in wireless networking terminology, a station, wireless client and node are often used
interchangeably, with no strict distinction existing between these terms. With a station also being referred as
transmitter or receiver based on its transmission characteristics.

IEEE 802.11-2007 formally defines station as:

*Any device that contains an IEEE 802.11-conformant media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) interface to the wireless medium (WM).*

**AP**

In computer networking, a **Wireless Access Point (WAP)** is a networking hardware device that allows a Wi-Fi compliant
device to connect to a wired network. The WAP usually connects to a router (via a wired network) as a standalone device,
but it can also be an integral component of the router itself.

A WAP is differentiated from a hotspot, which is the physical location where Wi-Fi access to a WLAN is available.

**Router**

A **router** is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the "traffic directing" functions on the Internet. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another through the networks that constitute the internetwork until it reaches its destination node.

A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks (as opposed to a network switch, which connects data lines from one single network). When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the address information in the packet to determine its ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey. This creates an overlay internetwork.

**Hotspot**

A **hotspot** is a physical location where people may obtain Internet access, typically using Wi-Fi technology, via a wireless local area network (WLAN) using a router connected to an internet service provider.
