## Terminology

**Station**

In IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) terminology, a **station (STA)** is a device that has the capability to use the 802.11 protocol.
For example, a station may be a laptop, a desktop PC, PDA, access point or Wi-Fi phone. An STA may be fixed, mobile or
portable. Generally in wireless networking terminology, a station, wireless client and node are often used
interchangeably, with no strict distinction existing between these terms. With a station also being referred as
transmitter or receiver based on its transmission characteristics.

IEEE 802.11-2007 formally defines station as:

*Any device that contains an IEEE 802.11-conformant media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) interface to the wireless medium (WM).*

**AP**

In computer networking, a **Wireless Access Point (WAP)** is a networking hardware device that allows a Wi-Fi compliant
device to connect to a wired network. The WAP usually connects to a router (via a wired network) as a standalone device,
but it can also be an integral component of the router itself.

A WAP is differentiated from a hotspot, which is the physical location where Wi-Fi access to a WLAN is available.
